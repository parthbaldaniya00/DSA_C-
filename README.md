# DSA_C++

Welcome to the **DSA_C++** repository! This repository contains a collection of resources, code implementations, and exercises focused on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. It is designed to help learners and practitioners enhance their understanding and skills in DSA.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Implementation and explanation of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Various algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and more.
- **Practice Problems**: Coding exercises to help you implement and solidify your DSA knowledge.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/Arrays/`: C++ implementations and exercises related to arrays.
- `/LinkedLists/`: C++ code for singly and doubly linked lists.
- `/Trees/`: Code for binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- `/Graphs/`: Implementations of graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.).
- `/Sorting/`: Different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
- `/Dynamic-Programming/`: C++ solutions to common dynamic programming problems.
- `/Other-Algorithms/`: Additional algorithms including greedy algorithms, backtracking, etc.
